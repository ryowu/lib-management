            <p>The Library Management System is an online system that allows users to borrow and return books, and staff
                to manage books using a CRUD window.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to make it easier for people to access and manage books. With our system, users can search
                for books, check availability, and request to borrow or reserve them online. Staff can manage the book
                collection, including adding new books, updating book information, and managing borrowing requests.</p>
            <p>Our system is easy to use and accessible from anywhere, so users can access the library services and
                manage their borrowing needs online.</p>
